<p>Location: 4-206A (LSC, Computer Science Department, glass room out of elevator on the left)</p>

<p>
In our fifth meeting we will have an in-depth discussion of Problem 3.7 of “Elements of Causal Inference” (link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/o4345krw428kyld/11283.pdf?dl=0) by Bernhard Schölkopf, Jonas Peters and Dominik Janzing.

<p>
In our fourth meeting we will play with some hands on problems at the end of chapter 3 and briefly discuss the assumptions for causal inference in Chapter 2 of “Elements of Causal Inference” (link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/o4345krw428kyld/11283.pdf?dl=0) by Bernhard Schölkopf, Jonas Peters and Dominik Janzing.

<h2>Week 1</h2>

<p>
  Time: 10am, Tuesday 19th of June 
Location: 4-206A (LSC, Computer Science Department, glass room out of elevator on the left)
</p>

<p>

The Causality Reading Group will meet for its first meeting this summer. We will discuss the last page of the short 4-page paper on “Statistics for big data: A perspective” by Peter Bühlmannand and Sara van de Geer, ETH Zürich. 
(attached, link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167715218300610)

Over the course of the summer, we will discuss questions such as: What is causality? How can we identify causality? Can we justify causal statements? 

Papers, opinions and speakers will come from Philosophy, Computer Science and Mathematics.
